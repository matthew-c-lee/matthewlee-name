# Travel Guide
This is a living document - let me know if you want me to add something!

Guidelines:
- Give the most useful coordinate to arrive at a place:
	- When possible, try to have the coordinate be right outside the entrance to a place.
- Connected Road Directions: If connected to a road, try to give approximate directions of where to branch off from the road to arrive at the place, alongside the normal coordinates.
	- If the *only* way to get to a place is via a road (ex: it's completely enclosed), then only give the Connected Road Directions.
- Only include the vertical Y coordinate if it's relevant (ex: the place is not on the surface).
